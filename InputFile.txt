In the above scenario, Ralph an American businessman works at a company and the company has sent him to Korea. However, Ralph does not like to travel abroad but he travelled anyway. The problem that faced Ralph when he went to Korea (Uncertainty Rejecting Country) and was the reason why the trip was unsuccessful that Ralph is from a different culture (Uncertainty Accepting Country) that have different culture combination for example, different rituals between the two cultures and different kind of customs. Some famous Korean customs, Baji, Chima, etc. Also, they have different traditions like, the Korean people bow instead of shaking hands. Furthermore, different ways of behaving between Koreans and Americans for example, Koreans avoid looking directly at him in the eyes. As a result, American businessman was uncomfortable at all even in the meetings and he felt that everything stinks and smells like, Kimchee. A personal example, once I travelled to Malaysia and I felt uncomfortable because almost everything was different even the food was not that good.
