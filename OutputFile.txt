In the above sNenario, Ralph an AmeriNan businessman works at a Nompany and the Nompany has sent him to Korea. However, Ralph does not like to travel abroad but he travelled anyway. The problem that faNed Ralph when he went to Korea (UnNertainty RejeNting Country) and was the reason why the trip was unsuNNessful that Ralph is from a different Nulture (UnNertainty ANNepting Country) that have different Nulture Nombination for example, different rituals between the two Nultures and different kind of Nustoms. Some famous Korean Nustoms, Baji, Chima, etN. Also, they have different traditions like, the Korean people bow instead of shaking hands. Furthermore, different ways of behaving between Koreans and AmeriNans for example, Koreans avoid looking direNtly at him in the eyes. As a result, AmeriNan businessman was unNomfortable at all even in the meetings and he felt that everything stinks and smells like, KimNhee. A personal example, onNe I travelled to Malaysia and I felt unNomfortable beNause almost everything was different even the food was not that good.
